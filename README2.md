## Features

### 1. Frontend (Next.js)
- Built with **Next.js**, offering **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for optimal performance.
- Responsive and interactive user interface for:
  - Browsing products.
  - Managing orders.
  - Handling user authentication.
- Fetches and displays data in real-time from backend APIs, ensuring users always have up-to-date information.

### 2. Sanity CMS
- Centralized backend for managing:
  - Product information.
  - User data.
  - Order records.
- Provides APIs for seamless integration with the frontend, enabling dynamic data management and real-time updates.

### 3. Third-Party APIs
#### Shipment Tracking API (ShipEngine)
- Fetches real-time shipping updates and generates tracking details for orders.
- Provides shipment statuses such as **"In Transit"**, **"Out for Delivery"**, etc.

#### Payment Gateway (Stripe)
- Securely processes financial transactions.
- Handles payment confirmation and transaction status updates.

### 4. Authentication (Clerk)
- Handles user registration, login, and session management.
- Integrates seamlessly with **Sanity CMS** to securely store user data.
- Ensures sensitive information is stored safely.

## Key Workflows

### 1. User Registration
**Process:**
1. User signs up via the frontend using **Clerk**.
2. Registration details are securely stored in **Sanity CMS**.

### 2. Product Browsing
**Process:**
1. User navigates through product categories on the frontend.
2. **Sanity CMS API** fetches product data, including:
   - Name
   - Price
   - Description
   - Images
3. Dynamic product listings are displayed on the frontend.

### 3. Order Placement
**Process:**
1. User adds products to the cart and proceeds to checkout.
2. Order details (products, quantities, shipping address) are sent to **Sanity CMS**.
3. Payment is processed securely via **Stripe**.

### 4. Shipment Tracking
**Process:**
1. After order placement, shipment details are updated using **ShipEngine**.
2. Real-time tracking information is displayed to the user on the frontend.

## 3. Third-Party Integrations
- **Payment Gateways**: Expand support for additional payment gateways to provide users with more secure transaction options.
- **Enhanced ShipEngine Integration**: Support more detailed carrier data for improved shipment tracking accuracy.

## 4. Security Enhancements
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement 2FA to secure user accounts.
- **Regular Dependency Audits**: Regularly audit and update third-party dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure system security.

## 5. Performance Optimization
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Utilize SSR and ISR to enhance page load times and SEO performance.
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize image sizes and implement lazy loading to reduce load times on product pages.
